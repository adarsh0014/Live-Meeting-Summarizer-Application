So it's export the four audios and which we analysis previously inputted and transcripted and in data email summary directly to the stakeholders or the users. Yeah, as we have performed these many processes like transcribing summarizing analytics, so if a user wants to back log in and check the history of the sessions, like what have done, they previously done works before one week or before one month. So this session is still helps you to store those all the recordings or all the transcripts you have done till today. So if you want to reload the session back again, you can just upload the session ID and just load the sessions and you can see back the water transcripts or water the audio files you have given to this application. So every session is automatically saved and instantly accessed review and reload. So past conversation which creates a powerful impact on the user, so which helps you to restore the data which you might not forget for the long time. So this is a feature we added sir about this session history and coming to the our main aim to be like transcript the summarizers meetings and the complete platform for capturing and understanding and activating your conversional intelligence to the main points. Now, question you will do the demo. Yes, thank you. So now I'm going to just share my screen and show you our demo sir. Sir, can you see the screen? Yes, I can please. Yes, yeah. Yes, sir. So this is our application live meeting summarization as explained in the PPT. This is the login page where the user creates is a account like you can say carry is a username and you can just enter your email personal or any email you can just enter so you can receive a notification to email and password. Yeah, after signing up, you can see sir, it shows you that the user is successfully and you can just go back to the login and login into your like can enter the what are the previous data you have used to enter login sign up. Yeah, after clicking login, you can just go back you can go into the application and you can view that here. This is a feature we added extra is that the status where you can see if application is on id like not running or processing anything the status will be given as idle. So these these first tab shows you this live recording as an upload file. We have the extra feature we are added is that browser based as well as local microphone as while deploying it we have found a problem is that the streamlit users the local microphone whereas if we want to deploy or run this application on other websites like browsers chrome or google so it doesn't access to the local microphone which so we added is that browser based so it just directly access the microphone from the browser the user is using so it enables the user to use any type of microphone it they are using and next coming to the upload file and you can just see that it shows your upload file where click the browser file can just upload the file which is in the format of mp3 and wabv and after just clicking the process upload file and it shows the process recording generating a summarization and transcribing it yeah you can see here sir like the meeting is for the process successfully and the session id also it gonna display it and if you go to tab 2 that is transcript and summary it shows what are the text or what are the words they have speak in the audio file so this is a direct transcript of it and here right side you can see the summary of it in a short way and if you want to as I said in the ppt there is a comparison of the models we are using so now we are using the worst model which is real time so it shows you the performance like how what is their speed accuracy word error rate as in comparison error rate in the form of charts and you can also see their in the form of value comparison as well as their accuracy its overall statistics is based is on tab 3 and and the next is that a few for user wants to export the transcripted files they have done till now they can just clicking on that you can just export using json markdown pdf and csvp just one click on them will show you the downloads like you can see sir four type of formatted PDFs are meeting transcripts are downloaded here and if he want to send them to a recipient like his friend or someone they can just go to the left side and enable the email application so sir can I get your email id so that it will send the transcript to your email file you can give any a dumb email id you something fine okay sir yeah I'll be giving mine yeah so after entering the recipient email you can just enter so it enables the the like we are sender information so that you can just enter there so I'm just going to use the maruti's one yeah so this will be the sender email like who are the sending so for example I'll first I'll just enter the right one yeah so after entering the app password you can just click this send email and it's going to send you the email like send it to the",
